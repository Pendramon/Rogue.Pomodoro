# Rogue.Pomodoro
***This application is a work in progress and is not yet functional.***

Allows you to blacklist everyday applications that you procrastinate on during your pomodoro.
The way the application works is it disallows you from opening any of the blacklisted apps during the pomodoro and instead of closing your open apps it sets them aside and prevents you from using them so that you can immediately get back to them without the need to open them again allowing you to continue what you were doing once the pomodoro is over.
